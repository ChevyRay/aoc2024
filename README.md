# Advent of Code 2024

These are puzzles for the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024)
challenge, written and solved in the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
programming language.

The puzzle for each day is in its own `.rs` file in `src/bin`, and can be run
using the following command (from the root folder):

```
cargo run --bin day1
```

Each day will also have a test, using the test input/output provided by the puzzle,
which can be run using:
